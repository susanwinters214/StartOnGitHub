    <h1>NuCamp Bootcamp Begins Today!</h1>
    <p>Our first lesson is to create a simple HTML web page and 
        upload it to GitHub 
        using the GitBash Terminal.
    </p>
    <p>I am very happy that we get to use Visual Studio Code in this
        bootcamp! I think it is a lot better than the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Sublime Text  </li>
            <li>Atom  </li>
            <li>Brackets  </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The first topic we are going to be covering is Bootstrap 4! I love Bootstrap 3 and have been using it 
        for several years so I'm excited to learn about all of the new features in version 4.

    <p>The content on this page was created while working with git so that I could commit several times just for practice.
        In this lesson, we learned how to initialize a local repository, along with 
        how to use basic commands to add files to staging then commit them, view the git log, check out earlier commits, and reset the repository.
